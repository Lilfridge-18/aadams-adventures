                <h1>So what's this all about then?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Hello there! You found my website, welcome!</p>
                <br>
                <p>If I'm honest, I'm not too sure why this exists either. Initially I thought it would be cool to actually store my photos somewhere, rather than the majority of them being on my laptop; where they would never see the light of day. Also, I didn't feel like I could post them all on instagram and I felt that a website was probably the best place...so here we are.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Really, I thought that on top of sharing more (hopefully) cool pics, it would be nice to talk about travelling around and the stories behind the pictures. I really like travelling and especially creating awesome photos from those experiences. I didn't want this to be a fleeting idea, one that would be long forgotten in the years to come, so mainly I hope this blog (is that really what I've become?...A blogger...nasty) will make sure I continue to travel and photograph!</p>
                <br>
                <p>As I travel more and get (much) better with the camera, I hope I can create this cool little place to tell you all about my adventures!</p>
                
                <p class="signature">Cheers,<br>Aadam</p>
